      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Data Training Dashboard </h3>
        <p>
         Developed a server-sided machine learning image classifier training service that client programs can access where information
         like current training accuracy and loss would be displayed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <h3>Tweet Sentiment Classifier</h3>
        <p>
          Built a machine-learning system trained on a dataset containing tweet and sentiment data.
          Implemented spaCy tokenizer and TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction and models like Decision Tree
          and Support Vector Machine.
        </p>
